I am a proud civil servant. <p> I could usually be found outside reflecting on how to honor my dad's legacy and learning more about nature, conservation, and the cosmos, but lately that's not the case, as more pressing problems need to be addressed.  (All views my own and do not reflect those of the U.S. Census Bureau and federal government).<a href="/read this">start here...</a></p></p>
