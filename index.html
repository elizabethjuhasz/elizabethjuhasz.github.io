			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>I'm Elizabeth Juhasz. I will be receiving a PhD from the University of New Orleans in December 2017. I studied political science, but also have a strong interest in merging the field with topics from Earth Science, geography, and others. I also have an interest in Higher Ed policy. If you would like to work on a project, please reach out to me. There is much to get done, and not much time. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
