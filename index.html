			<p><h5>"Genuine politics--politics worthy of the name, and the only politics I am willing to devote myself to--is simply a matter of serving those around us: serving the community and serving those who will come after us." Havel,  VÃ¡clav. 1993. <i>Summer Meditations.</i></h5></p>
			<p>I'm Elizabeth Juhasz. I received a PhD in political science from the University of New Orleans in December 2017. I am passionate about protecting migrants' rights and defending the environment. Most of my research interests include migration and environmental politics. If you would like to work on a project, please reach out to me. There is much to get done and not much time.
