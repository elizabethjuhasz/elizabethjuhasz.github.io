			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Born and raised in Miami, Florida. One of the great things about growing up in South Florida is that I learned early on about importance of environmental protection. I recieved a Bachelor's
			degree from Loyola University New Orleans where I double-majored in philosophy and psychology. After college, I went to an international school in Budapest, and studied Hungarian. I traveled throughout the
			Balkans, and began asking complex questions. I knew I had to go back to school. I came back to Miami, and worked temporarily at a bookstore. I loved working in sales, but I got in trouble for using Wikipedia 
			during work hours. Once again, I was reminded that I had to go to graduate school, except at the time, it became "now or never."<br />
			
			I always had a strong interest in international relations, and went to the University of New Orleans originally as a Master's student with a first concentration in international
			relations and a second concentration in comparative politics. I then transferred into the PhD program. My dissertation looks at how politics affects refugee status granting to asylum-seekers. I orginally 
			delve into the subject around 2013, when I noticed that it was a much ignored topic in international relations at the time.
			
			I mostly research migration, but my interests have expanded since then.  Being in the state of Louisiana for some time, and working in Higher Ed, I became very passionate about Higher Ed policy.
			I'm a strong advocate for open science, academic freedom, and net neutrality. I currently work as a part-time analyst at Miami Dade College, and I love my job.
			
			I am interested in climate-induced migration, and how natural resources affects asylum granting. However, I take a strong interest in merging topics like Earth Science, Geography, and other environmental sciences with political science. 
			My interests are wide, and I'm normally open to a wide range of topics.
			
			I enjoy taking pictures and traveling thanks to my parents. I don't travel to vacation, but rather, to learn about myself, others, and the world.</p>
