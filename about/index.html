			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. I recieved a Bachelor's degree from Loyola University New Orleans where I double-majored in philosophy and psychology. After college, I went to an international school in Budapest, and studied Hungarian. I traveled throughout the Balkans, and began asking complex questions. I knew I had to go back to school.I came back to Miami, and worked temporarily at a bookstore. I loved working in sales, but I got in trouble for using Wikipedia during work hours. Once again, I was reminded that I had to go to graduate school, except at the time, it became "now or never."
