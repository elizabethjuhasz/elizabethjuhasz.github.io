			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. During typical stormy afternoons in the summer months, which cut my outside playtime short, I spent hours looking at my global and reading my parents' <i>World Book Encylopedia</i>. Similarly, I have fond memories of getting lost in Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus library when my mom was working. Since I was young, whether for persuasion or self-education, I learned about the importance of research, and I haven't stopped since.</p> 
		        <p>I received a Bachelor's degree from Loyola University New Orleans where I double-majored in philosophy and psychology. After college, I went to an international school in Budapest, and studied Hungarian. I traveled throughout the Balkans, and began asking complex questions. While sitting on a bus on the way to Kosovo, I knew I had to go back to school. I came back to Miami, and temporarily worked at a bookstore. I loved working in sales and being surrounded by books, but I got in trouble for using Wikipedia during work hours. Once again, I was reminded that I had to go to graduate school except at the time, it became "now or never."</p>
			<p>I always had a strong interest in international relations. I went to the University of New Orleans, originally as a Master's student, and studied international relations and comparative politics. I then transferred into the PhD program. My dissertation examined how politics affects refugee status granting to asylum-seekers. I originally delve into the subject around 2013 when I noticed that it was a much ignored topic in international relations at the time. I mostly research migration, but my interests expanded since then. My time in Louisiana admist statewide budget cuts to Higher Education made me even more passionate about education.</p> 
			<p>I am interested in climate-induced migration, and how natural resources affect asylum granting. However, I take a strong interest in merging topics like Earth Science, Geography, and other environmental sciences with political science. One of the great things about growing up in South Florida is that I learned early on about importance of environmental protection. My interests are wide, and I'm normally open to a range of topics.</p>
			<p>I enjoy taking pictures and traveling thanks to my parents. I don't travel to vacation, but rather, to learn about myself, others, and the world. I'm a strong advocate for open science, academic freedom, and net neutrality. I also enjoy volunteering whenever I get the chance. I currently work as a research integrity coordinator and as an adjunct at Florida International University.</p>
