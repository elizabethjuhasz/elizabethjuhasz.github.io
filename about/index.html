			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I am a survey statistician for the The United States Census Bureau. Previously I worked for Florida International University's Institutional Review Board (IRB), Miami Dade College's IRB and Department of Institutional Effectiveness, and the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans ("UNO Poll"). As an undergraduate student, I also gained experience researching cellular biophysics under Dr. Armin Kargol.</p>
			<p>I went to Loyola University New Orleans and did a double major in philosophy and psychology. After college, I went to an international school in Budapest and studied Hungarian. I traveled throughout the Balkans, and began asking complex questions. While sitting on a bus on the way to Kosovo, I knew I had to go back to school.</p>
			<p>I went to the University of New Orleans, originally as a Master's student, and studied international relations and comparative politics. I then transferred into the PhD program. My dissertation quantitatively examined how politics affect refugee status granting to asylum-seekers. I originally delve into the subject around 2013 when I noticed that it was a much ignored topic in international relations at the time. (Needless to say, that all changed very quickly in a couple of years). My dissertation received the Distinguished Dissertation Award for the College of Liberal Arts, Education and Human Development.</p>
