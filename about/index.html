		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. My parents were refugees from Cuba and Hungary.</p> 
		        <p>I went to Loyola University New Orleans and did a double major in philosophy and psychology. After college, I went to an international school in Budapest, and studied Hungarian. I traveled throughout the Balkans, and began asking complex questions. While sitting on a bus on the way to Kosovo, I knew I had to go back to school.</p>
			<p>I went to the University of New Orleans, originally as a Master's student, and studied international relations and comparative politics. I then transferred into the PhD program. My dissertation examined how politics affects refugee status granting to asylum-seekers. I originally delve into the subject around 2013 when I noticed that it was a much ignored topic in international relations at the time. My dissertation received the Distinguished Dissertation Award for the College of Liberal Arts, Education and Human Development.</p> 
			<p>I currently work as a research integrity coordinator and as an adjunct at Florida International University.</p>
