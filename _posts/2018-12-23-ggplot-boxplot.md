Begin reading articles using quantitative methodology, and eventually you’ll run into boxplots.

Laura DeCicco has an excellent [post](https://owi.usgs.gov/blog/boxplots/) on ggplot2 boxplots. More so, the article flawlessly describes how to read boxplots, complete with excellent visualizations.  

Box plots are originally attributed to John W. Tukey, who was always way ahead of the game.  Flowingdata has a small blog [post](https://flowingdata.com/2008/01/01/john-tukey-and-the-beginning-of-interactive-graphics/) about Tukey and interactive graphics. The video linked in the post is especially telling, and [worth checking out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7XoW2qiFUA).  

Flowingdata also has a good [breakdown](https://flowingdata.com/2008/02/15/how-to-read-and-use-a-box-and-whisker-plot/
) of boxplots.  

Teaching methods or mathematics? There are also articles describing the pros and cons of teaching boxplots to students.  Though boxplots are not difficult to put together, many individuals struggle with interpreting them, even those with backgrounds in statistics or methodology. 

The following articles analyzing teaching boxplots to younger students, but I believe the articles are useful for anyone teaching methods.  For example, [Edwards, Özgün-Koca, and Barr (2017)](https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10691898.2017.1288556?needAccess=true) note in their literature review that students, even college students, struggle to visualize what aggregated data in the boxplot will look “like if they were disaggregated,” (22). Meaning “the difficulty lies in looking at a representation of the grouped data, but not an individual data point (Edwards, Özgün-Koca, and Barr 2017, 22).  The results of the authors later confirm that students struggled with interpreting aggregated data (24).  One recommendation these authors make to help students interpret boxplot information regards hands-on experiences (26), which I personally believe is more effective than traditional lecturing.  

[Bakker, Biehler, and Konold (2004)](https://iase-web.org/documents/papers/rt2004/4.2_Bakker_etal.pdf) also confirm the challenges students have when examining aggregate-level information.  They recommend that earlier statistical instruction focus on individual cases, but that individual cases should still be used when introducing aggregate plots, at least initially (165). Similar to Edwards, Özgün-Koca, and Barr (2017), educators should also focus on how to analyze densities in boxplots, with special emphasis on the inverse relationship between densities and the size of the box plot (Bakker, Biehler, and Konold 2004, 166).
